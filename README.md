# ngx-structurals

Structural utility directives for Angular.

The most commonly used [structural directives](https://angular.io/guide/structural-directives) are `*ngIf` and `*ngFor`
since they are shipped as built-ins with Angular. However, we are not limited to these and can implement our own. This
is an often under-appreciate, powerful concept baked into Angular. ngx-structural aims to provide structural directives
which may be useful in any Angular project.
